# realtor.com_dashboard
- I created an interactive dashboard in Tableau. I downloaded state level data from Realtor.com and created a map that shows YoY percent change and a dual axis line chart that shows average days on market compared to list price percent change MoM.

- You can filter the dual axis line chart by selecting a state in the dropdown selector or by clicking on a state in the map.
